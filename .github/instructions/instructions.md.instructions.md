# Context of the project
# - The project is a research project focused on developing a new, sparse LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) method for large language models. This adapter differs from the traditional LoRA adapter design in that the low-rank space is much larger than the original model's latent space.
# - The goal is to create an interpretable adapter that will allow for better understanding and control of the model's behavior.
# - The aim is to have the latents in the low-rank space be monosemantic, meaning that each latent should correspond to a single, interpretable concept.
# - Promote parameter and design decisions that improve the monosemanticity of the latents.
# - The project is in the early stages, with a focus on implementing and testing the new method.
